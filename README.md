## ⚙️ Tasks Implemented  

### **1️⃣ Predict Restaurant Ratings (Regression)**
- Goal: Predict aggregate restaurant ratings based on available features.  
- Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.  
- Metrics: RMSE, R² Score.  

### **2️⃣ Restaurant Recommendation System**
- Technique: Content-based filtering using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.  
- Input: Restaurant name or cuisine.  
- Output: List of similar restaurants based on textual similarity.  

### **3️⃣ Cuisine Classification**
- Task: Predict restaurant cuisine type using text data.  
- Model: Random Forest Classifier.  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.  

### **4️⃣ Location-Based Analysis**
- Performed geospatial visualization using Folium.  
- Grouped and clustered restaurants by city and locality.  
- Displayed heat maps and rating trends by region.
